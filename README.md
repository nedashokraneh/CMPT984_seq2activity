# CMPT984 seq2activity projects

This repository is for CMPT 984's genotype-to-phenotype projects. You can start with [basenji](https://github.com/calico/basenji/tree/master) to implement your models. 
We created a sample dataset (```data/basenji_data.tar.gz```) from 2063 assays. Data is obtained from [ENCODE](https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Experiment&control_type!=*&status=released&perturbed=false) and includes DNase-seq, ATAC-seq, and 4 histone modifications, H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K27ac, H3K9ac, for tissue biosamples. There are about 190k 600-bp training sequences that are chosen based on SNP coverage. A larger dataset including ~ 2.5M training sequences is uploaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KlibNwmethPUv9vsfYTrnFEh3vKFebQW/view?usp=sharing). Data is stored as TFRecord (TensorFlow records) files which are compatible with basenji pipelines. If you need data in other formats, you can load TFRecord files with basenji.dataset API and convert it to your format of interest. If you want to make your dataset, you can follow [make_dataset.sh](https://github.com/calico/basenji/tree/master/manuscripts/basset) to generate a Basset-style single peak annotation dataset, and let me know if you need help with that.
